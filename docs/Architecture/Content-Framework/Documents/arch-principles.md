# Architecture Principles

This should be a collection of the architecture principles that are used in the organization. This chapter is oriented on the [TOGAF® standard](https://publications.opengroup.org/standards/togaf/c220). 

## Role/Purpose

Architecture principles provide a foundation for decision-making and guide the development and evolution of the organization's architecture. They help ensure consistency, alignment with business goals, and effective communication among stakeholders.

## Contents

This will normally be organized as a table including the following information as defined by [TOGAF® ADM Techniques](https://publications.opengroup.org/standards/togaf/c220):

| Content | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Name | A concise and descriptive name for the principle |
| Statement | A clear and concise statement that defines the principle |
| Rationale | An explanation of the reasoning behind the principle and its importance to the organization |
| Implications | A description of the implications of the principle for architecture development and decision-making |

## Principle States

If new principles are added or existing principles are changed, a review and approval process should be followed to ensure that they are aligned with the organization's goals and objectives.

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Draft | Principle is being developed and is not yet finalized |
| Proposed | Principle is proposed and under review |
| Approved | Principle is approved and valid |
| Deprecated | Principle is no longer valid and should not be used |
| Rejected | Principle is rejected and not valid |
