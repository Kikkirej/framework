# Product / Project Documentation

## Role/Purpose

The classic [Architecture Definition Document (ADD)](./arch-definition-document.md) is often too much for products or the complete documentation of a project solution. Therefore I split this from the ADD to have a more focused document. 

This document needs to be updated with each implementation of the an architecture change. 

Other than most documents in this standard, this document is not a TOGAF® standard deliverable. 

This can also been seen as a baseline architecture document for an architecture project.

## Dependencies

## Document States

This document is more a documentation and doesn´t need the classic approval workflow. To stay TOGAF® conformant the states are still including Draft and Approved.

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Draft | Document is worked on and not yet approved |
| Review | Optional State to make it transparent that the document is in review |
| Approved | Document is approved and valid. Important is that the approval comes from the stakeholders |
| Obsolete | Document is obsolete and not valid anymore. This might be because the project was cancelled or a new version is available. |


## Document Templates

An example template is [Arc42 Template](https://arc42.org/) which is more lightweight and easier to use.
