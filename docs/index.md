# Welcome

In the past years of my career I loooked at different Operations and Architecture scenarios. 

On this journey I learned some standards in different detail grades.

This standards include, but not limit to

* [The Open Group Architecture Framework(TOGAF)](https://www.opengroup.org/togaf)
    + including linked publications like the [TOGAF Leader's guide](https://publications.opengroup.org/g168)
* [arc42](https://arc42.org/)
* ITIL 4
* ...

These standards are often very open. In this documentation I share possible real world implementations while utilizing proven standards. 

This is a collection to help in the establishment of an EA Capability or a Service Delivery Capability. 

Besides processes and standards also practical tools from my point of view are referenced.
