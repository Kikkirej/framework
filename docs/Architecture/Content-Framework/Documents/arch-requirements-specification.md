# Architecture Requirement Specification

This document captures the requirements that the architecture must meet. This chapter is oriented on the [TOGAF® standard](https://publications.opengroup.org/standards/togaf/c220). This is part of phase all phases in the ADM cycle and should be updated continuously.

## Role/Purpose

The Architecture Requirements Specification (ARS) defines the requirements that the architecture must meet to support the business goals and objectives.

## Chapters

Following chapters should be part of the document.

| Content | Description | Required |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Success Measures | Define the success measures that will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the architecture | Yes |
| Business Service Contracts | Define the business service contracts that the architecture must support | Yes |
| Application Service Contracts | Define the application service contracts that the architecture must support | Yes |
| Implementation Guidelines | Define the implementation guidelines that must be followed during the architecture implementation | No |
| Implementation Specification | Define the implementation specifications that must be followed during the architecture implementation | No |
| Implementation Standards | Define the implementation standards that must be followed during the architecture implementation | No |
| Interoperability Requirements | Define the interoperability requirements that the architecture must meet to ensure seamless integration with existing systems and processes | No |
| IT Service Management Requirements | Define the IT service management requirements that the architecture must support to ensure effective service delivery and management | No |
| Constraints | Define the constraints that must be considered during the architecture development and implementation | Yes |
| Assumptions | Define the assumptions that have been made during the architecture development | No |

Following data should be part of each requirement:

* Unique Identifier
* Description
* Rationale
* Source
* Priority

This might be done in a table or in a requirements management tool. Also EA tools like Sparx EA or others can be used to manage this information.
