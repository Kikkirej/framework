# Architecture Contract
<!-- https://digital-portfolio.opengroup.org/togaf-standard-architecture-content/latest/01-doc/chap04.html -->
## Role/Purpose
The Architecture Contract defines the agreement between the architecture team and the project teams regarding the responsibilities, deliverables, and expectations for architecture-related activities. 

This document is based on the [TOGAF® standard](https://publications.opengroup.org/standards/togaf/c220). This is part of phase F in the ADM cycle.

From my experience one of the most important parts, especially in large organisations or if no work experience as a wider team exists. 

This contract then can be monitored and all principles and guidelines are transparent.

Additionally ownership is clearly defined and an escalation process is effective.

## Contents

The contract is between different parties, which are shared in the following. All points are taken from the TOGAF® standard, but some content from the standard is left out to keep it slim and easier. 

### Contract between Architecture Design and Development Partners

This will start with the preliminary phase

| Content | Description | Required |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Introduction and Background | Overview of the architecture project and its context for everyone to get the clear | Yes |
| Scope of the Architecture | Define the scope of the architecture work, including systems, domains, and boundaries | No |
| Architecture and strategic principles and requirements | Refer to the corresponding documents and if needed, shortly summarize important points. | Yes |
| Conformance Requirements | Define the requirements for architecture compliance, including processes, tools, and standards to be followed by the development teams | Yes |
| Target Architecture Measures | Define the metrics and criteria for measuring the success of the architecture implementation | No |
| Defined phases of deliverables | Define the phases of the architecture work and the corresponding deliverables for each phase | No |
| Prioritized joint workplan | Define a joint workplan that outlines the tasks, timelines, and responsibilities for both the architecture team and the development partners | No |
| Time window | this will be often handled by Product Management/Product Owner. But the Architect should definitely moderate it. | No |

### Contract between Architecture Function and Business Stakeholders

This will be started when the migration and impelmentation plan has been agreed to gether with the business stakeholders. This guarantees the business stakeholders are aware of their responsibilities and the architecture work. This also ensures that the architecture work is aligned with business goals and objectives.

| Content | Description | Required |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Introduction and Background | Overview of the architecture project and its context for everyone to get the clear | Yes |
| Scope | Define the scope of the contract | Yes |
| Strategic Requirements | Define the strategic requirements from a business perspective that the architecture must support | Yes |
| Architecture deliverables | Define the architecture deliverables that will be provided to the business stakeholders | Yes |
| Conformance Requirements | Define the requirements for architecture compliance, including processes, tools, and standards to be followed by the business stakeholders | Yes |
| Time Window and SLA | Define the time window for architecture deliverables and the service level agreements (SLAs) for response times and issue resolution | No |

## Document States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Draft | Document is worked on and not yet approved |
| Review | Optional State to make it transparent that the document is in review |
| Approved | Document is approved and valid. Important is that the approval comes from the stakeholders, including a representative from the Development Partners |
| Obsolete | Document is obsolete and not valid anymore. This might be because the project was cancelled or a new version is available.

## Document Templates

An example template is part of [TOGAF® Standard, 10th Edition Template Deliverables](https://publications.opengroup.org/i094). This might be a good starting point.
