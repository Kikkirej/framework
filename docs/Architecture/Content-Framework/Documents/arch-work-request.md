# Request for Architecture Work

This document captures the request for architecture work. It normally starts an Architecture project. This chapter is oriented on the [TOGAF® standard](https://publications.opengroup.org/standards/togaf/c220).

## Role/Purpose

The Request for Architecture Work (RAW) is a document that formally requests the initiation of architecture work. It outlines the business need, objectives, and scope of the architecture effort.

This can be handled over a ticket system or be a formal document in the repository.
